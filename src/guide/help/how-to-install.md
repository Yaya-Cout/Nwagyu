# How to install

Installing a NWA app on your NumWorks calculator takes less than a minute.
First, you download a nwa app on your computer, for example from our
[apps page](../apps/). Then you install it on your calculator.

## General case

Usually you just need a nwa file. Here’s how to make it work:

1. Download a .nwa file on your computer
2. Go to [NumWorks’s installer](https://my.numworks.com/apps) from your
   computer. Note: You’ll need to use a Chromium-based browser (e.g. Chrome).
3. Click the “Connect” button
4. A form should appear : use the file you downloaded in step 1.
5. Press the “Install” button that just appeared.

## Apps that needs some external data

Some apps will need some external data to work. For example, Playa will need a
video file to work. In this case, the steps are a little bit more complicated.

1. Download the .nwa file, for example playa.nwa
2. Download the additional extra file that’s needed, for example `video.bin` for
   Playa, your ROM in `.gb`/`.gba` for Peanut-GB/GBC, a ROM in `.nes` for
   Nofrendo, a `.png` file for PNG Viewer…
3. Head to [NumWorks’ app installer](https://my.numworks.com/apps)
4. Select the .nwa app. The installer will tell you that the app needs an
   external file.
5. Use the second file as an external file.
6. Press install!

## Apps that are too large

If you want to install an app that is over 2.5 MB you will need to use our
[memory extender](./enlarge-your-memory.md).

::: info
Memory extender isn't usually required, and can cause problems in some cases on
newer software versions. If you just want to install apps, follow the guide
[above](#general-case).

## What if it doesn’t work ?

If the upload doesn’t work, here are some things worth trying:

- Make sure you’re using the latest version of your Chromium-based browser that
  support WebUSB
- Close all your browser tabs but one
- Try another USB cable
- Reset your calculator by using a pencil to press the reset button on the back
