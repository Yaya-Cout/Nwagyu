# Mandelbrot

This app draws the [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) on your calculator screen.

## Origin

This app is inspired by the sample Python script that ships with the NumWorks
calculator. But because this app is written in native code, it is close to 100x
faster than the Python version!

## Controls

The controls are pretty intuitive:

| Key        | Action      |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Arrow keys | Move around |
| +          | Zoom in     |
| -          | Zoom out    |
