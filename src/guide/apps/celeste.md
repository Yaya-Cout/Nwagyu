# Celeste Classic

Did you ever heard about Celeste, this famous platform video game? A less-known
fact is that this game was first developed in 4 days for the PICO-8 virtual
console, before being renamed Celeste Classic.

What if you could play Celesta Classic on your calculator, for free? Thanks to
the port by [BenchatonDev](https://github.com/BenchatonDev), this is now
possible!
