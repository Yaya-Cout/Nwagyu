## How to play

The controls can look complex for the first time, but once you understand them,
they're quite easy to remember:

| Action                  | NumWorks          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Camera                  | Arrow keys        |
| Go forward              | Toolbox           |
| Go backward             | Comma             |
| Left                    | Imaginary (i)     |
| Right                   | Power (e^x)       |
| Go upward               | Shift             |
| Go downward             | Exponential (e^x) |
| Move block cursor left  | Left parenthesis  |
| Move block cursor right | Right parenthesis |
| Open inventory          | Var               |
| Place a block           | OK                |
| Destroy a block         | Back              |
| Save and exit           | EXE               |

The motion keys (forward, backward, left and right) keys form a pattern like a
computer arrow keys (or WASD keys if you prefer).
