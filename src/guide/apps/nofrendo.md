# Nofrendo

Nofrendo is a NES emulator. Do you want to play your original Mario cartridge on
your NumWorks calculator? Search no more! Thanks to this emulator, you’ll also
be able to revive many other classic games like Super Mario Bros 3, The Legend
of Zelda, Metroid or Castlevania!

## How to get games

We can't provide you any games, because of legal reasons. However, you can
download games from the internet easily. A search like "nes roms" should
give you plenty of results. You can also dump your own cartridges.

You will need to add your rom as an external file. To do so, follow the
instructions in the [how to install](../help/how-to-install.md) guide.

## How to play

The controls are rather straightforward, because the NumWorks calculator uses a
layout that’s very similar to the NES gamepad. Select and start are less
obvious, so here’s a recap:

| NES gamepad | NumWorks   |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Arrow keys  | Arrow keys |
| A           | Back       |
| B           | OK         |
| Select      | Shift      |
| Start       | Backspace  |
