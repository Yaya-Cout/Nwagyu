# KhiCAS

<!-- FIXME: Translate it if it's needed (I didn't translated it because I'm
lazy) -->

KhiCAS is a [CAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)

There is not a lot of documentation about KhiCAS, and it is not very
user-friendly, but it is still a very powerful tool. If you want to learn more
about KhiCAS, you can read some [documentation](#documentation)

## Documentation

As KhiCAS is very powerful, you need to know which command to use.

First, this version have some limitations compared to others version of KhiCAS
for NumWorks (because of NumWorks limitations) :

- You can't save your session (supported in the [new version])
- Crash very often (when using power `^` for example, fixed in the [new version])
- **To access the menu, you have to use Shift + EXE instead of Home**,

There is a lot of different sources to learn how to use KhiCAS :

- A [short documentation](https://github.com/Yaya-Cout/KhiCAS_guide/blob/626b9786ff19504152628cfa42447c87ab73f648/KhiCAS_guide.pdf),
  in french with illustrations, should be easy to start using KhiCAS
  (recommended for beginners)
- The [great video of Schraf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wykeOAVYMFI) to
  learn KhiCAS
- The [official website](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~parisse/numworks/khicasnw.html),
  which is very complete

You can also search for documentation for [Giac/Xcas](https://xcas.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/),
